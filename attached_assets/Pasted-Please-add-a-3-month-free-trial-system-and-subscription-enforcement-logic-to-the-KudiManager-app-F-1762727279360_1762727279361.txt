Please add a 3-month free trial system and subscription enforcement logic to the KudiManager app:

Free Trial Rules:

When a user registers, automatically record created_at (current date) and set their plan to "trial".

The free trial lasts 90 days (3 months) from the registration date.

During this period, users can access all features.

7 days before expiration, display a warning banner on the dashboard:

“Your free trial ends on [date]. Subscribe now for ₦2,500/month to continue using KudiManager.”

After the 90th day:

Restrict access to the main dashboard and all API calls.

Redirect users to the Subscription Page with this message:

“Your trial has ended. Please subscribe to continue using KudiManager.”

Subscription Activation:

When payment succeeds via Paystack webhook:

Update user record:

{
  "plan": "basic",
  "subscribed_on": "2025-11-06",
  "expires_on": "2025-12-06",
  "is_active": true
}


Unlock dashboard access again.

UI Requirements:

Add a trial banner at the top of the dashboard:

Shows “Trial active — X days left” in gold color.

If expired, show “Trial expired — Subscribe to continue” in red.

Add logic to compute remaining trial days:

const daysLeft = 90 - Math.floor((Date.now() - new Date(user.created_at)) / (1000*60*60*24));


Display this on dashboard dynamically.

Access Control Logic:

Check user plan status before allowing dashboard access:

If plan === "trial" and less than 90 days → allow.

If plan === "trial" and ≥ 90 days → redirect to /subscribe.

If plan === "basic" or plan === "premium" and expires_on is in future → allow.

Otherwise → lock access and show subscription prompt.

Subscription Page Updates:

When user subscribes successfully, replace their “trial” plan with “basic”.

Reset expiration every month.

Auto-renew logic: optional — can display “Renew manually” for now.

Visuals:

Use Emerald Green (#007F5F) for active banners, Gold (#F4C542) for warnings, and Red (#D93A3A) for expired status.

Ensure logic works across mobile and desktop.

Once complete, confirm that:

Trial users can access full features for 3 months.

Warning appears 7 days before expiry.

Dashboard locks automatically after expiry.

Paystack payment re-activates access instantly.
