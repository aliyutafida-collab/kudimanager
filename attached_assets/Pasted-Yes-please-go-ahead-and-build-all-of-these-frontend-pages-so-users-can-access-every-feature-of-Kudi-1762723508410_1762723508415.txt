Yes, please go ahead and build all of these frontend pages so users can access every feature of KudiManager.

Include the following pages and sections with a consistent, mobile-friendly UI:

1️⃣ Tax Calculator Page:
A simple page where users can input total monthly sales and expenses.
It should calculate estimated tax based on Nigerian small business tax rules (20% corporate tax under ₦25M turnover, 7.5% VAT, and state tax advisory).
Show results clearly with an “AI tip” section below.

2️⃣ AI Business Advisor Section:
A page where users can input their sales, expenses, and profit for the month.
The AI should return 3 short insights using the /api/ai/advice endpoint.
Design it like a conversation card or chat interface with “Your Insight” messages from the AI.

3️⃣ Learning Resources / Tutorial Page:
Include the full Financial Management Guide content (as we discussed earlier).
It should explain topics like: sales recording, expense management, inventory, profit calculation, tax basics, and AI advice.
Add an icon for each topic and use simple, clear formatting suitable for Nigerian SME owners.

4️⃣ Vendor Directory / Suggestion Page:
A page where users can type in what they want to buy (e.g., “flour,” “POS machine,” “cement”) and get 3 AI-suggested vendors from the /api/vendors/suggest endpoint.
Show results as vendor cards with name, category, and contact suggestion.

5️⃣ Subscription / Billing Page:
A clean pricing plan page connected to the /api/subscribe endpoint.
Plans:

Basic (₦2,500/month): Core features (sales, expenses, inventory, reports)

Premium (₦5,000/month): All features + AI + tax calculator + learning tools
Include Paystack integration button for “Subscribe Now.”

6️⃣ Dashboard Summary Page:
Add a simple dashboard that displays:

Total Sales (₦)

Total Expenses (₦)

Net Profit (₦)

Stock Level Summary
Include a “Smart Tips” area that fetches AI advice automatically, and show a small “low stock” alert area.

7️⃣ Color Theme and Branding:
Use the KudiManager color theme:

Primary Color: Emerald Green #007F5F

Accent Color: Gold #F4C542

Background: Light Gray #F6F7F9

Text: Charcoal #333333
Use Inter or Poppins font for a modern, professional look.
Buttons should have rounded corners (8px) and hover transitions.

Ensure all pages share the same consistent layout, theme, and smooth navigation.
